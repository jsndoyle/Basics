- What is your favorite programming language? Why?

Sri - Python, it's simple, easy.
Jay - I like Python if I'm doing scripting, as I can import basically anything I ever want. Otherwise, I enjoy writing in C because it makes me feel like I'm hacking the mainframes and it's fast.

- Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

Sri - I guess Java or C would be, since we've used that the most during school.
Jay - I honestly have no clue what language I'm the most experienced in. Probably Java. Not my favorite, although I've used it.
